        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a first year Ph.D. student and <a href="http://grad.gatech.edu/PresFellows">President's Fellow</a> in <a href="http://ml.gatech.edu">Machine Learning</a> at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="">Rachel Cummings</a>. My research interests include differential privacy, algorithmic game theory, and fairness in machine learning, particularly the interplay of these areas.</p> 
        <p>Prior to this, I received a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Operations Research both from the Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2018.</p>
        <p>You can reach me at [first][last]7@gatech.edu or in my office at [office address].</p>
