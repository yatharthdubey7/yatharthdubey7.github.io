        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a first year Ph.D. student in <a href="http://aco.gatech.edu">Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO)</a> at the Georgia Institute of Technology where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="">Dr. Rachel Cummings</a>. My research interests include studying the algorithmic foundations of privacy, in particular the relationship between the local and trusted curator models of differential privacy. I am also interested in studying privacy as it relates to economics and, more broadly, the social sciences.</p> 
        <p>I received my B.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Operations Research both from the Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2018. I spent the summer before graduate school studying mean estimation algorithms in the hybrid model of differential privacy with <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~korolova">Dr. Aleksandra Korolova</a> as a Visiting Research Scholar at USC.</p>
        <p>You can reach me at [first][last]7@gatech.edu or via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yatharthdubey/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
